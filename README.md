# Generate Buildcraft Recipes from the source code

I found that some of the BC recipes where out of date on the various wikis and other sources on the internet. This project will generate the recipes from the BC source code.

## Version

This generates from the branch `8.0.x-1.12.2` targeting Minecraft 1.12.

## Bonus screenshots

I have also a bunch of screenshots from older releases back when the guidebook contained more recipes. For a overview of them [click there](guidebook.md)!

## Output

`make` till produce `recipes.md` and `guidebook.md`.  You can find a checked in version of the files here:

* [recipes.md](recipes.md)
* [guidebook.md](guidebook.md)
